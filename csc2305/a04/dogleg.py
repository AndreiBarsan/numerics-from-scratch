    Problem statement (4.2 from [NW]):
        Write a program that implements the dogleg method. Choose Bk to be the
        exact Hessian. Apply it to solve Rosenbrockâ€™s function (2.22).

        Experiment with the update rule for the trust region by changing the
        constants in Algorithm 4.1, or by designing your own rules.
